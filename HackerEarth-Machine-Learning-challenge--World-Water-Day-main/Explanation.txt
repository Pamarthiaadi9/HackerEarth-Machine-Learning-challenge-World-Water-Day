Approach Explanation


The given dataset is used to predict water consumption using machine learning techniques. The following steps were followed to preprocess the data and train an optimal model:


1. Data Loading
* The training and testing datasets were uploaded in drive and loaded using Pandas.
   
2. Datetime Feature Engineering
* The `Timestamp` column is converted into a datetime object.
* Extracted new features: `Hour`, `Day`, `Month`, `DayOfWeek`, and `IsWeekend`.
* The `Timestamp` column is dropped after feature extraction.
   
3. Handling Missing Values
* Numerical missing values are replaced with the mean of the respective columns.
* Categorical missing values are filled using the mode (most frequent value) of the respective columns.
   
4. Categorical Encoding
* Used `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical columns into numerical values for training.
* Ensured that unknown categories in the test set are handled appropriately.
   
5. Feature Scaling
* Standardization is applied using `StandardScaler` to ensure all numerical features are on the same scale.
   
6. Model Selection and Training
* Choosed `XGBoost Regressor` due to its efficiency in handling structured datasets and strong predictive capabilities.
* Used the squared error loss function (`reg:squared error`) for regression.
* Hyperparameters:
- `n_estimators=600`: Number of boosting rounds.
- `learning_rate=0.03`: Controls the step size during training.
             - `max_depth=8`: Limits the depth of each tree to avoid overfitting.
             - `colsample_bytree=0.8`: Controls the fraction of features used per tree.
   - Trained the model using the processed training dataset.
   
7. Prediction and Submission
* The trained model predicts water consumption for the test dataset.
* The predictions are rounded to two decimal places for better readability.
* The output is stored in a CSV file (`submission.csv`) containing the `Timestamp` and predicted `Water_Consumption`.


Feature Engineering Details
* Timestamp Features: Hour, Day, Month, DayOfWeek, IsWeekend (derived from Timestamp).
* Missing Value Handling: Mean imputation for numerical values, mode imputation for categorical values.
* Encoding: Label Encoding for categorical variables.
* Scaling:Standardization using StandardScaler.


Tools Used
* Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
* NumPy: Numerical computations.
* scikit-learn: Preprocessing (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder).
* XGBoost: Model training and prediction.


This pipeline ensures that the data is well-prepared and that the model generalizes effectively for water consumption prediction.
